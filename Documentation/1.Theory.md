# How does an relational database works

## Brief Explanation

A relational database is a sophisticated piece of software that is used to manage
and store information following a set of technical and conventional foundations
called the *Relational Model*, created in 1970 by Edgard Frank Codd.

The relational model is build by several points that explain how information should
be treated. More information can be found in this [article].(https://www.oracle.com/database/what-is-a-relational-database/)

For the purpose of this part of the documentation, we will only need to understand
the fundamental structure of the relational databases: *The Table*.

The concept of a table is a fundamental aspect of relational databases. As previously
mentioned, databases adhere to conventions to manage information breaking it down into 
'entities'. Entities, in this context, serve as encapsulations of a set of attributes
that collectively compose specific information.

To illustrate, consider a person as an entity. Attributes like hair color, skin color,
gender, ethnicity, etc., can be identified as characteristics describing that entity. An
entity essentially represents a conceptual grouping of attributes chosen arbitrarily to
define and describe something.

In the realm of relational databases, a table serves as the concrete manifestation of an
entity. It is a structured arrangement that organizes data according to the defined
attributes of an entity.

Each row in the table corresponds to a specific instance or
record of the entity, and each column represents a distinct attribute.

In essence, tables translate the abstract idea of entities into a format that can be
efficiently stored, queried, and managed within a database. They serve as the backbone of
relational databases, providing a systematic and organized means of representing and
working with diverse sets of information.
