The mechanism for interacting with the program is set, now we need to start to think
how to make operations to do something. After all, the only thing that our "SQL query"
can do is to allow us to quit the program.

So we need something that can translate the queries that we give to the program into
instructions that could be applied inside a database, somo sort of "*compiler*".

This "*compiler*" is not really what you would call a compiler in the strict technical 
definition. It is more refered to a set of 3 main characteristics of SQL: Tokenizer,
parser and code generator. These will be the first pieces of the software that we'll 
be interested on, each one of these have a certain purpose in the processing of the 
queries that are introduced into SQL.

## 1. Tokenizer

The tokenizer is the component that divides the query into the smallest units possible for this
context, the *tokens*. These are just the words that compose a transaction or query that you
apply into the SQL prompt.

## 2. Parser

This is a sintactic parser of the already tokenized querie, it verifies the logic of the
tokens to state if the query is logical or not

## 3. Code Generator

This has the purpose of transform the tokenized and parsed transaction into a set of instructions
that the SQL engine can understand to interact with the database.
